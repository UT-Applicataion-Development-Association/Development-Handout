# Git-Secret
This post is about giving a introduction to git secret which is a bash tool for encrypting and protecting files in a git repository

## GPG
Git secret is using **gpg** an open source project for encrypting files.

Below is a list of commonly used commands of gpg

- `gpg --list-key`: List out all public keys

- `gpg --list-secrey-keys`: List out all secret keys

- `gpg --gen-key`: Generate new private key
    - gpg requires a name of the key and a email for creating a key
    
    - The email will be used as the user id of the key
    
    - Also, it requires a passphrase which will be used to export and for revealing the encrypted file

- `gpt --armor --output <output file> --export <user id>`: Export **public key**

- `gpg --armor --output <output file> --export-secret-keys <user id>`: Export **secret key**

- `gpg --import <private key>`: Import the key

## Git Secret
1. Initialize a git secret repository
    - `git-secret init`  This initializes a .gitsecret folder under the repository
    
2. Add private key for encryption the <user> is used to locate the private key in the local
    - `git-secret tell <user>`
    
3. Add files for encryption
    - `git-secret add <file>`
    
    - Meanwhile, git secret will try to detect whether the files are mentioned in the .gitignoreï¼Œ if not, it will
    automatically add the file to the .gitignore for preventing accidentally pushing the file to the repo 
    
4. Hide files
    - `git-secret hide`
    
    - After hide, the original file will be encrypted and hidden from the local 
      
    - Meanwhile, an encrypted version end with .secret will be created
    
5. Push to the repo
    - This step is same as you usually do
    
    - But, you should only push the encrypted version to your repo
    
6. Reveal file
    - `git-secret reveal`
    
    - The above command will prompt you to enter the passphrase for revealing the original file
