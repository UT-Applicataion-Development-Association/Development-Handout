# Git Ignore & Github files

## Git Ignore
It is a common need to ignore certain files to be added to your repository since they are irrelevant to the repository, 
or they are hidden files generated by the OS or IDE which are added to the repository accidentally.   You can create a
.gitignore as a blacklist for listing files that should not be added to the repository.  The way that .gitignore used is
including a list of files or patterns thus if any file added to the repository is in the list then those files will not
be pushed to the repository.  The github provides a series of gitignore template for different projects, here, we just
show you some basic usage of the .gitignore.
```
# Hash Tag means the comment
# You can list out a file or directory with specific name like this
test.py
.idea/

# You can list out file extensions by using regex
*.o

# You can also add recusive rule for files that may exist in any subdirectory
*/.DS_Store
```

## Github files
The github allows you to add new templates for github issue and pull request beside the defaults provided by the Github.
To do this you need to create a folder named `.github`.  For adding new templates you need to add the sub-folder
under the `.github`.  Then, you can add the template written in the markdown to the template folder.
- ISSUE_TEMPLATE: The folder for storing different templates for github issue.
  
- PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE: The folder for storing different template for github pull request.
